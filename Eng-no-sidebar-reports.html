                                    </p>
                                    <ol>
                                    <li> 
                                    <h4>Scientific Decision-Making Tool </h4>
                                    <p> Financial statements are considered great decision-making tools. They show business trends and tendencies, and how the firm is collecting money, and at which rates creditors are being paid. They also help you deduct any abnormal patterns that might negatively impact your business cash flow.</p>
                                    <p>For example, accounts receivable reports and aging analysis reports allow you to see who of your customers is paying their debts on time and who is not. Therefore, you can make educated decisions on who needs more follow-ups and collection efforts. You would also know who of your customers is more reliable. </p>
                                    <p>On the other hand, accounts payable reports alerts you about what your business owes to the others, so you can make financial plan to make payments on time. </p>
                                    <p> Other reports could help you monitor inventory level and its valuations.  So, no matter what questions you might have about your business, proper financial and MIS reporting can provide you with an answer. </p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li> 
                                    <h4>Knowledge of Current Cash Flow: </h4>
                                    <p> Cash Flow Statement illustrates the company’s financial solvency and its ability to pay its liabilities. It breaks the statement into operating, investing, and financial sections. Review of cash flow helps the managers understand whether the business is operating under a cyclical revenue stream structure or consistent revenue model. As a result, this helps the company to structure the business expenditure is such a way that it remains within the revenue model the company operates in. 
                                    </p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                    <h4>Awareness of the Liability: </h4>
                                    <p>Company’s long and short term financial commitments are shown in their financial statements.  Both equity investors and debt lenders closely scrutinize the financial statements of the company in order to make their investing decisions in the company. So, the key here is to keep company liability in a manageable level. </p>
                                    </li>

                                    <li>
                                    <h4>Monitoring of Inventory Movement:</h4>
                                    <p>Inventory movement effectiveness is measured by inventory related ratios, such as the average inventory over purchases and sales. These ratios show the activity and nature of goods of the business. Accompanied with other MIS reports, they tell us what goods are fast-moving and are in rapid demand. They also provide valuable information with regards to changes in sale trends, variation in cost of purchased goods,  and changes in customer tastes, among other indicators. Slow-moving goods have negative impact on business growth. Therefore, business leaders need to examine these indicators and make fast, wise, and educated decision to decrease the negative impact. </p>
